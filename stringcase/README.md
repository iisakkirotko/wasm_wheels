# NOTE

As you may note from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/stringcase/) there is (or was on 5.2.2025) no version 1.3.0 of stringcase. The wheel labeled 1.3.0 here is built off of master of [okunishinishi/python-stringcase](https://github.com/okunishinishi/python-stringcase) at the time, since there are numerous unreleased fixes available there. Specifically the build is based on commit [57aae96](https://github.com/okunishinishi/python-stringcase/commit/57aae96649f5cf7fc98e50b1d62479456d492715).

The version labeled 1.2.0 is built based on commit [6a5c5bb](https://github.com/okunishinishi/python-stringcase/commit/6a5c5bbd3fe5337862abc7fd0853a0f36e18b2e1).
